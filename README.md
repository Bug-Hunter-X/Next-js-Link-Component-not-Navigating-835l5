# Next.js Link Component Not Navigating

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Next.js's `Link` component where links appear to be defined correctly, but clicking them does not result in navigation.  The issue often stems from misconfigurations or overlooked details in how the `Link` component is used within the application.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` in `bug.js` shows correctly implemented `Link` components, however, clicking on these links does not trigger page navigation.  The console may not reveal any errors. This is a subtle bug that can be difficult to detect for developers unfamiliar with the intricacies of Next.js routing.
